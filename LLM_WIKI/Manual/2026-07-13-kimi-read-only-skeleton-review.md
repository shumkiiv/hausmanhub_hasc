# Kimi review: private read-only skeleton

Date: 2026-07-13.

## Scope

Review of the final uncommitted `custom_components/hausman_hub/` skeleton,
its safety tests, translations, and documentation. The review was read-only:
no commit, push, deploy, Home Assistant runtime, live API, or service call was
authorized or performed.

## Kimi result

Kimi reviewed the safety posture and found no blocking safety issue:

- only `read-only` and `shadow` are accepted;
- `proxy` and direct modes are rejected and the stored direct status must stay
  `direct_execution_blocked`;
- diagnostics are constructed from an allow-list and do not copy entry data;
- manual repair guidance creates no issue, action, or device authority;
- the pure domain/application layers do not import Home Assistant.

The Kimi session reached an internal tool-message limit before it could emit a
clean formal verdict. Its only compatibility question was the older
`FlowResult` type annotation in `config_flow.py`. Codex checked the official
Home Assistant Core `2026.7.0` source: `FlowResult` remains exported and
`ConfigFlowResult` derives from it. No code change was required. More specific
result types can be considered later as a non-blocking style improvement.

## Verification

- `python3 -m compileall -q custom_components hausmanhub_validation tools tests`
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — 17 passed
- JSON syntax checks for manifest and both translations
- no `hacs.json`, service definition, entity platform, or execution surface

The local environment has no Home Assistant package, so no runtime load test
was run. This is intentional: this stage permits local, read-only verification
only and does not authorize a live-home test.
