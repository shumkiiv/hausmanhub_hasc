# Kimi review: diagnostics allow-list structure test

Date: 2026-07-13.

## Scope

Read-only review of the new diagnostics structure test in
`tests/test_read_only_skeleton.py`. The test exercises only the pure
`diagnostics_snapshot` use case and does not start Home Assistant or access a
home, device, service, Node-RED, credential, or network API.

## Final Kimi result

Kimi found:

- Blocking findings: none.
- Non-blocking findings: none.

The review session was `ses_0a39ebf46ffe0NOXx2AGlPTx5j`; it did not modify
repository files.

## Verification

- `python3 -m compileall -q custom_components hausmanhub_validation tools tests`
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — 23 passed
- isolated Home Assistant Core 2026.7.0 smoke check — passed
- `git diff --check`

The new test fixes the exact permitted top-level and nested diagnostics keys,
so a future data expansion requires an explicit review rather than silently
exposing additional configuration facts.
