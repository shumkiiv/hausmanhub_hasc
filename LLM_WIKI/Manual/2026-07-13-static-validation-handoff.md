# Static validation implementation handoff

Date: 2026-07-13.

## Completed scope

The first code-level HausmanHub step is complete as a Python-standard-library-only
fixture harness. It adds:

- synthetic Common inventory fixtures and schema validation;
- negative checks for unknown contours, missing rooms, execution-oriented
  fields, execution claims in audit data, and Common ownership of a domain
  decision;
- synthetic shadow-evidence validation that keeps parity unresolved and direct
  execution blocked;
- synthetic redacted diagnostics and manual-only repairs validation;
- local `unittest` coverage and a small fixture CLI.

## Hard boundary preserved

No Home Assistant or Node-RED runtime is imported, contacted, or changed. No
live IDs, secrets, service paths, command payloads, flows, deploy scripts,
`custom_components/`, or `hacs.json` are present. A validator pass proves only
synthetic schema consistency.

## Verification

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 tools/validate_fixture.py common fixtures/common_contract/valid_minimal.json
```

## Next decision

The only next implementation decision is whether a private read-only
`custom_components/hausman_hub/` skeleton is needed. It still requires a
separate approval. Proxy and direct execution stay blocked.
