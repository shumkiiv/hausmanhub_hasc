# Kimi review: public HACS correction

Date: 2026-07-14.

## Scope

Read-only review after the owner approved making the GitHub repository public
so it can be added manually in HACS. The staged change corrects repository and
HACS instructions, records that private HACS use is unavailable, and renames a
test for clarity without changing its behavior.

## Review and remediation

The first review found three outdated phrases that could imply the repository
was still private. They were corrected in the skeleton title, decision record,
and short project context.

## Final Kimi result

- Blocking findings: none.
- Non-blocking findings: none.

Final review session: `ses_0a118a6b2ffeqgYGcQKyfviK8j`. The reviewer did not
modify repository files.

## Verification

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — 24 passed
- `python3 -m compileall -q custom_components hausmanhub_validation tools tests`
- `python3 -m json.tool hacs.json`
- `git diff --cached --check`
- GitHub visibility confirmed as `PUBLIC`
