# Kimi review: HACS package check

Date: 2026-07-15.

## Scope

The new local package check verifies the prepared Git package for manual HACS
installation. It reads local Git-index blobs and modes only. It does not load
HausmanHub, contact HACS or Home Assistant, or access a home.

## Final result

Kimi session `ses_098e9da62ffeLNnrziiBK2FP2f` (model `k2p7`) returned
`NO FINDINGS`.

The review checked the index-only boundary, required regular files, approved
metadata and manifest shape, JSON and translation checks, icon validation,
release-note version check, negative tests, and the absence of network or home
control capability.

## Verification

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — 105 passed.
- `python3 tools/check_hacs_package.py` — passed.
- `python3 tools/check_local_release.py` — passed.

All checks used local Git data and synthetic test data only. No real Home
Assistant, Node-RED, device, credential, or home data was accessed.
