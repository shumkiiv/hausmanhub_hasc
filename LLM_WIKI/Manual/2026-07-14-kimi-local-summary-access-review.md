# Kimi review: local nine-count access

Date: 2026-07-14.

## Scope

Kimi reviewed the staged v0.2.0 change that adds the guarded local HausmanHub
nine-count summary route. The review was read-only: it did not edit files,
create credentials, contact a home, or make a commit or push.

## Result

No findings.

Kimi confirmed the fixed nine-field allow-list, Home Assistant authentication,
the exact `system-read-only` group check, local/loopback source restriction,
GET-only route shape, and fail-closed behaviour for an invalid configuration
or an unloaded entry. It found no command, service, outgoing connection,
secret, live identifier, or architecture-boundary violation.

## Checks reported by the review

- The local test suite passed: 39 tests.
- The staged file list was unchanged after review; no unstaged or untracked
  files were created.
- Kimi did not run the isolated real-Core check because its review environment
  was intentionally not allowed to install dependencies. Codex ran that check
  separately against Core 2026.6.4 and 2026.7.0 with temporary empty
  configurations and a loopback-only test server; both passed.
