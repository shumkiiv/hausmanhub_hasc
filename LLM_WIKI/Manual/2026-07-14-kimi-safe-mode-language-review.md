# Kimi review: safe-mode language

Date: 2026-07-14.

## Scope

Read-only review of the English and Russian Home Assistant config-flow text,
the Russian safe-check guide, and the test that keeps the user-facing wording
honest.

## Review cycle

The first review found four wording and coverage issues: an old mode name in
the guide, inconsistent English spelling, incomplete text coverage in the
test, and a Russian word that could imply a future permission change. All four
were corrected.

The final review found no blocking or non-blocking issues. It confirmed that
the text-only change preserves the read-only/shadow boundary and adds no
runtime, device, service, proxy, or direct-execution surface.

Final review session: `ses_0a0b41401ffeajY46mUm9TntSF`. Kimi used the
read-only review agent and did not modify files or run commit/push.
