# Kimi review: fixed manual-repairs contract

Date: 2026-07-13.

## Scope

Read-only review of the fixed manual-repair category contract in
`custom_components/hausman_hub/application/repairs.py` and its tests. The
change is framework-independent and has no Home Assistant, device, service,
Node-RED, or network operation.

## Review and remediation

The initial review found no blocking issue and identified two test gaps. The
final change now exposes an immutable `MANUAL_REPAIR_CATEGORIES` set, so the
test locks the complete approved category set, and it requires guidance text to
be a non-empty string.

## Final Kimi result

The repeat review reported:

- Blocking findings: none.
- Non-blocking findings: none.

The final review session was `ses_0a39929dcffeQCoRAE1dRi4H5Z`; it did not
modify repository files.

## Verification

- `python3 -m compileall -q custom_components hausmanhub_validation tools tests`
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — 24 passed
- isolated Home Assistant Core 2026.7.0 smoke check — passed
- `git diff --check`

The contract exposes only static human guidance. It does not create issues,
perform repairs, or grant execution authority.
