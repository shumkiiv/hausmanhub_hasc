# Read-only skeleton decision handoff

Date: 2026-07-13.

The next HausmanHub boundary is an explicit owner decision: either keep the project
schema-only or approve a private read-only `hausman_hub` skeleton. The decision
record is `docs/read-only-skeleton-decision.md`.

No skeleton, HACS metadata, proxy, service access, device authority, or direct
execution was created while preparing this record. If option 2 is approved,
implementation must be a separate Clean Architecture commit with local tests
and Kimi review of its final diff.
