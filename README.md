# HausMan Hub HASC

Read-only foundation for a future Home Assistant custom integration for
HausMan Hub.

## Current status

This repository contains a public, read-only Home Assistant skeleton under
`custom_components/hausman_hub/`. It contains no device-control runtime,
entity platform, or service definition.

- Visibility: public.
- License: MIT.
- Supported Home Assistant baseline: Core 2026.6.4 or newer.
- HACS: available as a manually added custom repository; it is not in the
  public HACS catalog.
- Allowed initial modes: read-only and shadow only.

## Hard boundaries

This repository does not own Climate policy, Automation policy, the Common
smart-home contract, or Smart Home Center decisions. It must not deploy
Node-RED, invoke Home Assistant services, hold device authority, or contain
secrets, live entity identifiers, flow snapshots, service paths, command
payloads, or deployment scripts.

Proxy requires a separate owner approval and rollback notes. Direct execution
is blocked until proven shadow parity, a separate canary/rollback/authority
decision, and owner signoff.

## Current safe scope

1. Add synthetic read-only fixtures and a static Common-contract validator.
2. Add a shadow-evidence model and redacted diagnostics contract.
3. Develop the read-only skeleton only with synthetic data and local
   validation.

See [repository basics](docs/repository-basics.md) and
[AI context](AI_CONTEXT.md) before changing the repository.

## Local validation

The repository uses standard-library Python checks over synthetic fixtures
only. See [static validation](docs/static-validation.md) for the local command
and its safety boundary.

All future code follows the [engineering standards](docs/engineering-standards.md),
including mandatory Kimi review before completion or push.

See [the read-only skeleton](docs/read-only-skeleton.md) for its exact safety
boundary.

## Installation through HACS

This is not a public HACS listing. Add this GitHub repository manually as a
custom HACS repository.

1. In HACS, open the menu in the top-right corner and choose **Custom
   repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/shumkiiv/hausmanhub_hasc` and choose the
   **Integration** type.
3. Find **HausMan Hub HASC** in HACS and install it.
4. Restart Home Assistant, then add **HausMan Hub HASC** from its integration
   settings. Choose only `read-only` or `shadow`.

Installation does not grant device control. It must not be used to call
services, send commands, or enable `proxy` or direct execution.

For the short, safe Home Assistant check after installation, see the Russian
[safe-check guide](docs/home-assistant-safe-check.md).
