# Repository basics

Established on 2026-07-13 for the separate HausmanHub workstream.

## Repository identity

- GitHub repository: `shumkiiv/hausmanhub_hacs`.
- Visibility: public, explicitly approved by the owner on 2026-07-14 so HACS
  can read the repository. It is not listed in the public HACS catalog.
- License: MIT.
- Default branch: `main`.
- Home Assistant baseline: Core 2026.6.4 or newer.
- HACS metadata: approved for manual custom-repository installation on
  2026-07-14. It does not approve inclusion in the public HACS catalog.

## Allowed scope

The initial modes are read-only and shadow. Work may use only synthetic data
and local, read-only validation.

The first implementation work, when explicitly requested, is limited to:

1. synthetic fixtures and a static validator for the Common smart-home
   contract;
2. a shadow-evidence model;
3. a redacted diagnostics contract.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- Do not modify or deploy the HausmanHub Node-RED/Home Assistant runtime.
- Do not call a live home during repository checks. Runtime code may call only
  the explicitly armed single-`input_boolean` canary's standard on/off service;
  physical devices and every other service domain remain excluded.
- Do not own or change Climate, Automation, Common, or Smart Home Center
  policy.
- Do not add secrets, `.env` files, tokens, Node-RED flows, live entity IDs,
  service paths, physical command payloads, or deployment scripts.
- Keep HausmanHub commits separate from climate fixes, Node-RED deployment, and
  Smart Home Center runtime work.

Proxy is possible only after separate owner approval and documented rollback.
General device execution remains `direct_execution_blocked` until proven
shadow parity, a device-specific canary and rollback plan, explicit authority
transfer, and owner signoff. The version 0.4.0 helper-only canary is not an
authority transfer to a physical device.

## Architecture sources

The runtime repository's architecture documents remain read-only sources. The
relevant set covers contour ownership, the Common contract, Automation
registry, Climate hardening, Smart Home Center facade, the HACS spike,
read-only contract tests, config/options flow, diagnostics and repairs, shadow
parity, and direct-execution authority guardrails.

Do not copy runtime configuration or sensitive examples from that repository.

## Engineering quality gate

All future code follows Clean Code and Clean Architecture: dependencies point
inward to framework-independent domain contracts, and external adapters do not
own domain policy. Every code change needs independent review. Kimi must review
the final current diff before the change is considered complete or before a
commit, push, release, deployment, or publication. If Kimi is
temporarily unavailable, another independent review may support every change
permitted by the HausmanHub boundaries, including code, tests, documentation, and
local checks or fixes. It does not authorize a commit, push, release,
deployment, publication, or new authority. Documentation-only edits do not
require Kimi only when the change contains no code; the final Kimi gate applies
to a mixed diff. Review findings must be addressed or explicitly documented.
This quality gate does not relax any runtime, authority, or execution boundary.
